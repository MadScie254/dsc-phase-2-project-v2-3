# House Sales Analysis in a Northwestern County

## Overview

This project aims to analyze house sales in a northwestern county using multiple linear regression modeling. The goal is to provide insights and recommendations to stakeholders, such as a real estate agency or homeowners, on how home renovations might increase the estimated value of properties.

## Business and Data Understanding

### Stakeholder Audience

The stakeholder for this project is a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and sell homes. The agency wants to provide valuable advice to homeowners about how home renovations can impact the estimated value of their properties. By understanding the factors that influence house prices, the agency can offer targeted recommendations to homeowners and assist them in making informed decisions regarding renovations.

### Data Understanding

The dataset used for this analysis is the King County House Sales dataset. It contains information about various features of houses, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, condition, and grade, among others. The dataset is suitable for the project as it provides a comprehensive overview of house sales in the northwestern county.

## Modeling

In this project, we used multiple linear regression modeling to analyze the relationship between the features in the dataset and house prices. The objective was to build a predictive model that could estimate the value of homes based on their characteristics.

### Regression Results

We iteratively built multiple regression models, starting with a basic model and progressively refining it. The final model achieved a satisfactory performance, with a low mean squared error (MSE) and a high R-squared value. The key findings from the regression analysis include the significant impact of certain features, such as square footage and number of bathrooms, on house prices. These insights can be used by the real estate agency to provide valuable recommendations to homeowners on which renovations might have the most significant impact on their property value.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project utilized multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county. By understanding the factors that influence house prices, we were able to provide valuable insights to our stakeholder, a real estate agency. The regression analysis highlighted the impact of certain features on house prices, allowing the agency to offer targeted recommendations to homeowners regarding renovations that can increase their property value. This project demonstrates the value of using data-driven approaches to analyze real estate data and support informed decision-making in the housing market.
